Ilya walked slowly with a bundle marked ZX-14 hidden under his cloak, while Soren kept close, watching the crowds with cautious eyes. The banners of the Consortium fluttered faintly in the rising wind, carrying the scent of sea salt inland. Children\u2019s laughter rang out from a distant courtyard, though it seemed oddly fragile in the heavy air. Ilya\u2019s boots echoed against the stone, each step louder than he expected, as though the city itself demanded attention. Soren muttered that some nights wore the weight of secrets more heavily than others. Caldrith\u2019s lamps flickered to life, one by one, until the entire square glowed with a light that seemed both welcoming and suspicious, a paradox that clung to every face passing by.",

Thalen pointed to lanterns glowing faintly in shuttered windows, claiming they were messages meant only for those who knew how to read them.
